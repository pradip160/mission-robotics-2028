# Day 3 - Linux folder Organisation for Robotics 

## Topics
Linux folders, file paths, file creation, file edition, file reading, and robotics project organization.

## What I practiced
- Used mkdir to create a robotics folders
- Used touch to create a file
- Used nano to edit file 
- Used cat to read a file 
- Used mv to rename a wrong file names
- Used tree to check folder structure
- Practice Linux paths like sensors/camera.txt and control/motor-control.txt

## Robot project folders
- sensors: stores camera and lidar files 
- navigation: stores path planning files 
- control: stores motores control files 
- logs: stors robot activities files

## Robotic thinking 
A robot project should be organized clearly because each part has a different job.

Sensors collect data.
Navigation decide where to go.
Control send movement command.
Config store settings.
Logs record what happened.

## Mistakes I learned from 
- Linux file name must match exactly
- sensor and sensors are different
- motor-contrl.txt and motor-control.txt are different 
- Typing a file name alone makes linux it is a command
- mv need two parts: old name and new name

## Commands learned 
mkdir = create folder
touch = create file
nano = edit file
cat = open file 
mv = move or rename file
tree = show folder structure 
ls = list file and folders
ls a = show hidden folders

## Reflection 
Today I learned hwo to organise a robotics project using Linux.
I learned that a Linux path is like and address.

Example:
sensors/camera.txt means camera.txt is inside sensors folder.
I also learned the Linux file name must match exactly.
Small spelling mistakes can create errors.

This is useful for robotics because robot projects need
clean folders for sensors, navigation, control, logs, and settings.
